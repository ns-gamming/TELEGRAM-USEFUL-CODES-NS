# 🚀 Telegram Useful Codes NS  

Welcome friend! ❤️  
This is a collection of **useful & working Telegram codes** written by me (**Naboraj Sarkar / NS**).  
I made this repo with love so that everyone can **learn, use, and enjoy coding freely** 🌍✨

## 📺 Tutorials & Guides  
Every code here comes with a **step-by-step video tutorial** on my YouTube channel.  
👉 If you don’t find the tutorial link in the code folder, please check out my **[Telegram Bot Codes Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=YOUR-PLAYLIST-ID)**.  
I have explained **everything in detail** there — from A to Z ✅  

🎥 My tutorials are:  
- Easy to understand (simple English + real examples).  
- Beginner-friendly and well explained.  
- Made with nice video & audio quality.  

So even if you’re a **beginner**, don’t worry… you can follow along easily 💡

## ⚡ Free but Please Give Credit 🙏  
All the codes here are **100% free to use** 🎉  
You can use them in your own projects, edit them, or even learn from them — but please:  

- **Don’t claim it as your own** ❌  
- Always **give credit to me (NS – Naboraj Sarkar)** when you share or use this code ✅  
- If you make something cool with my code, tag me! I’d love to see it 💖  

Remember: These files could easily be sold as **paid resources**, but I decided to **share them FREE for everyone** — because I believe in **learning together** 🌟
